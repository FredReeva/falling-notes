# Falling Notes üå†

Welcome to Falling Notes! The aim of this musical-app is to provide a functional and beautiful melody generator. You can insert the chords you want and we will do our best to compute a melody that fits the progression. You can tweak some parameters and listen to the result on the fly with a couple of sounds that we provide. In the meantime, the background will display a visual and musical landscape that evolves according to the chord progression and the melody. If you like the result and want to experiment more, you can download a MIDI file containing both the melody and the chords.
If you have any doubt you can find an "info" section on the top right, which briefly resumes the content of this documentation. 

Enjoy!

PS: Here we provide a short [demo](https://youtu.be/KQRXkWLWtYU) of the app.

## Part 1: Graphical User Interface

This is how the main screen of the app looks like when reproducing a song:
